"""
Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in
a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names
alphabetically and print each name on a new line.
Example
records = [["chi", 20.0],["beta", 50.0],["alpha", 50.0]]
The ordered list of scores is [20.0, 50.0], so the second lowest score is 50.0.
There are two students with that score: ["beta","alpha"]. Ordered alphabetically,
the names are printed as:
alpha
beta
