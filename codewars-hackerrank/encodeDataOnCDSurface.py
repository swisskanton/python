"""
"Pits" and "lands" are physical features on the surface of a CD that represent binary
data. Pits are small depressions or grooves on the surface of the CD, while lands are
flat areas between two adjacent pits.

The pits and lands themselves do not directly represent the zeros and ones of binary
data. Instead, Non-return-to-zero, inverted encoding is used: a change from pit to
land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a zero.

In this Kata, you should implement a function, that takes integer in range [0..255]
(8 bits), and returns combination of pits and lands that encode the number. Result should
have format of string: PLLPL... where P represents pit and L represents land.
Combination should always start with pit. Numbers should be encoded in little-endian,
which means you start from least significant bit.
    Example
Input: 5
Binary representation (8 bits): 00000101
Output: PLLPPPPPP

    Explanation:
Starts from P as per description
Changes to L because first bit is 1
Stays L because second bit is 0
Changes to P because third bit is 1
Stays P because fourth bit is 0
Stays P till the end because all subsequent bits are 0
