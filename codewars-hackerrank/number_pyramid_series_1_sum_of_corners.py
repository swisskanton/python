Number Pyramid
Image a number pyramid starts with 1, and the numbers increasing by 1.

For example, when the pyramid has 3 levels:

  1
 2 3
4 5 6
And the sum of three corners are:

1 + 4 + 6 = 11
Input:
You will be given a number n, which means how many levels the pyramid has.

0 <= n <= 5000

Output:
You need to return the sum of three corners of the pyramid.

When there is no level, return 0 as there is no corner.

When there is only one level, return 1 as it is the only corner.

Examples:

sum_corners(0) --> 0
sum_corners(1) --> 1
sum_corners(2) --> 6
sum_corners(3) --> 11

# sum_corners = lambda n: sum(range(n+1)) + sum(range(n)) + 2 if n > 1 else n

print(sum_corners(0), '== 0')
