"""
Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations.
Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of 1 km length connecting it to
the next city. It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the
last city. Determine the maximum distance from any city to its nearest space station.
Example
n = 3
c = [1]
There are n = 3 cities and city 1 has a space station. They occur consecutively along a
route. City 0 is 1 - 0 = 1 unit away and city 2 is 2 - 1  = 1 units away. City 1 is 0
units from its nearest space station as one is located there. The maximum distance is 1.
